# Langchain Learning

## This notebook is to display my learning and testing around LangChain.

Course details can be found here:

## How to get started

### Pre-requisites
- A browser
- Ensure you have python 3.12 or above
- Ensure you have pip

### Steps:
1. Clone the repo from the langchain GitHub: git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/lca-lc-foundations.git
2. Make sure you are in the correct directory
3. Copy the .env file but change the following:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
    - TAVILY_API_KEY
    - LANGSMITH_API_KEY

### LangSmith Studio
To run LangSmith Studio, you need to have the `.py` with agent information. Then have `langgraph.json` file that is pointing towards the correct environment file and python file. If all is correct, a new browser window will open with the graph and a web interface for you to directly speak to your agent.

## My Feedback

- Module 1 was great! As someone who prompts ChatGPT and Gemini, it's so good to translate the knowledge I have with the actual inner workings of an agent. The concept sounds scary but very familar to Power Automate and Flows!
